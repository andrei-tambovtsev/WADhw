    <h2>About the homework</h2>
    <div>
      <p>It was the hardest homework so far.
      We went from excitement to devastation in seconds. <br>
      It was pretty exhausing, but...fun?&#129320;</p>
      <p> The hardest part was to figure out how to put everything we knew earlier to work with vue. <br>
        For example if I want to make a variable - where should I put it? <br>
        In data? In store? And how to access it from other files? <br>
      </p>
      Pretty confusing. Need to practise more. <br>
      And we started to forget a little bit what we knew before.

      <p> But overall we are looking forward to the next homework.</p>
